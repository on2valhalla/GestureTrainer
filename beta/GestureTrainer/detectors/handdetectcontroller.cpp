	Modified from ColorDetector from chapter 3 of the cookbook:

	Created by: Jason Carlisle Mann (on2valhalla | jcm2207@columbia.edu)

	A singleton wrapper class for HandDetector, to gain continuity
	throughout the program, and also to provide more simple access
	to its methods, and a local cache of the most recent images.
